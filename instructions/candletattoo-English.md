## Step 1: Preparation – Printing the Tattoos

The first and most important step is correctly printing your tattoos.

1.  **Select Printer and Paper:** Load the special candle tattoo paper (waterslide decal paper) into your **laser printer**. Make sure you print on the correct side – usually, the printable side is glossy or slightly sticky. If in doubt, do a test print on a normal sheet of paper and compare it to the film.
2.  **Open PDF and Print Settings:** Open your candle tattoo print template in a PDF reader (e.g., Adobe Acrobat Reader).
    *   Go to "Print."
    *   Select your laser printer.
    *   Ensure that the **scaling is set to "Actual Size" or "100%"** so that the motifs retain their correct size.
    *   Select the **highest print quality** for optimal results.
    *   Print your template.

## Step 2: Cutting Out the Motifs

After printing, the individual motifs are cut out.

1.  **Rough Cutting:** Roughly cut out the individual candle tattoo motifs from the sheet with scissors.
2.  **Fine Cutting:** Now cut out each motif as precisely as possible along its contour. The more accurately you cut, the more inconspicuous the edge of the tattoo will be on the candle.

## Step 3: Placing the Candle Tattoo in Water

Now the tattoo will be separated from its backing paper.

1.  **Prepare Water:** Fill a bowl with lukewarm water.
2.  **Soak:** Carefully place the cut-out candle tattoo into the water with the printed side facing up.
3.  **Waiting Time:** Leave the tattoo in the water for approx. 10-30 seconds until the film can be easily slid off the backing paper. Make sure it doesn't stay in the water for too long, otherwise, it will become too soft and harder to handle.

## Step 4: Applying the Tattoo to the Candle

The most exciting part – transferring the motif to the candle!

1.  **Positioning:** Take the tattoo out of the water. Hold it at one end of the backing paper and position it at the desired spot on the candle.
2.  **Sliding:** Carefully slide the tattoo film directly from the backing paper onto the candle. Pull the backing paper away from under the film as you do so.
3.  **Smoothing and Removing Air Bubbles:** Once the tattoo is on the candle, gently smooth it from the center outwards with a squeegee, a credit card, or a soft cloth. This will remove water and any air bubbles under the film. Be gentle so as not to damage the tattoo.
4.  **Blotting Excess Water:** Gently blot away excess water with a clean cloth or paper towel.
